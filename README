This is a drop-in replacement for java.util.Hashtable, written by
Dr. Cliff Click and donated to public domain. The repository was
in sourceforge and seems to be not as well-known as it should be.
So I moved it here in the hope of letting more java developers
use it.

To build it:
	javac build.java
	java build all
You can also check out README.cliffc for more instructions.
There's also a video by Dr. Cliff Click talking about the lib:
